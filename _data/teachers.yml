azhar:
  name: Azhar Hafeez
  bio: |
    A prolific photographer, Muhammad Azhar Hafeez was born in Faisalabad in 1971.  He had his first degree in graphic design, specializing PHOTOGRAPHY as a major subject from National College of Arts, Lahore, Pakistan in 1993. Since graduation, camera remains on his shoulder ever, and has captured the stunning shoots of endless themes and scenes.
    He doesn’t restrict himself capturing the scenes of Pakistani culture but also got an opportunity to photograph the gigantic life and landscape of the Xinjiang province of China. Azhar is a professional photographer and also has a job as an assistant controller creative in IT department, Pakistan Television Corporation Islamabad. Azhar believes that for a perfect click, one must be honest with his profession then the creative result appears.
    25 years ago, Azhar started photography with an idea of ‘SEE & SHOOT’ which reflects his own intuitive response to the subjects of everyday life. His intuitive feel for world and mankind is always visible whenever he squints through the lens. Azhar is busy in capturing the every creative moment surround him and don’t bother to title his photographs. This seems a sensible decision that he should be busy doing his work and let the art critics do their part. Azhar touches many subjects; therefore, his works are stretched to ambiance change.
